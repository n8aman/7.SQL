SELECT CURTIME();
SELECT CURDATE();
SELECT DAYOFWEEK(CURDATE());
SELECT DAYOFWEEK(NOW());
SELECT DATE_FORMAT(NOW(), '%w') + 1;
SELECT DAYNAME(NOW());
SELECT DATE_FORMAT(NOW(), '%W');
SELECT DATE_FORMAT(CURDATE(), '%m/%d/%Y');

SELECT * FROM people WHERE birthtime BETWEEN CAST('12:00:00' AS TIME) AND CAST('16:00:00' AS TIME);

### VIEW
-- INSTEAD OF TYPING THIS QUERY ALL THE TIME...
SELECT title, released_year, genre, rating, first_name, last_name FROM reviews
JOIN series ON series.id = reviews.series_id
JOIN reviewers ON reviewers.id = reviews.reviewer_id;
 -- WE CAN CREATE A VIEW:
CREATE VIEW full_reviews ASSELECT title, released_year, genre, rating, first_name, last_name FROM reviews
JOIN series ON series.id = reviews.series_id
OIN reviewers ON reviewers.id = reviews.reviewer_id;
 
-- NOW WE CAN TREAT THAT VIEW AS A VIRTUAL TABLE 
-- (AT LEAST WHEN IT COMES TO SELECTING)
SELECT * FROM full_reviews;
CREATE VIEW ordered_series AS
SELECT * FROM series ORDER BY released_year;
 
CREATE OR REPLACE VIEW ordered_series AS
SELECT * FROM series ORDER BY released_year DESC;
 
ALTER VIEW ordered_series AS
SELECT * FROM series ORDER BY released_year;
DROP VIEW ordered_series;


### joins
-- To perform a (kind of useless) cross join:SELECT * FROM customers, orders;
-- The order doesn't matter here:SELECT * FROM ordersJOIN customers ON customers.id = orders.customer_id; or vice versa.
JOIN____ON_________
INNER JOIN, LEFT JOIN, RIGHT JOIN,
GROUP BY first_name , last_name
ORDER BY total{first_name, last_name, SUM(amount) AS total};


### GROUP BY
(HAVING, ROLLUP,) COUNT(rating) > 1; GROUP BY title WITH ROLLUP;


### To View Modes:
SELECT @@GLOBAL.sql_mode;
SELECT @@SESSION.sql_mode;
 
-- To Set Them:
SET GLOBAL sql_mode = 'modes';
SET SESSION sql_mode = 'modes';
STRICT_TRANS_TABLE
ONLY_FULL_GROUP_BY

### windowsFunction Using Over()
PARTITION BY, RANK(),  ROW_NUMBER(),  DENSE_RANK(), NTILE(),  FIRST_

### sub- queries
SELECT * FROM orders WHERE customer_id = (SELECT id FROM customers WHERE last_name = 'abc');

### ER(entity relationship) diagram
Entities â€“ Real-world objects or concepts (e.g., Student, Course).

Attributes â€“ Properties of those entities (e.g., Student Name, Course Title).ðŸ”¸ Simple Attribute: Cannot be divided further.Example: FirstName ðŸ”¸ Composite Attribute: Can be broken into sub-parts.Example: FullName â†’ FirstName + LastName ðŸ”¸ Derived Attribute: Can be derived from other attributes.Example: Age from DOBðŸ”¸ Key Attribute: Uniquely identifies an entity.Example: StudentID

Relationships â€“ Associations between entities (e.g., A Student enrolls in a Course).ðŸ”¸ One-to-One (1:1): One entity relates to only one of another.ðŸ”¸ One-to-Many (1:N): One entity relates to many of another.ðŸ”¸ Many-to-Many (M:N): Many entities relate to many others.


# SQL Advance.
-- 1) adjusting max packet size to allow large files to run
SET GLOBAL max_allowed_packet = 1073741824;
-- 2) adjusting your SQL mode to allow invalid dates and use a smarter GROUP BY setting
SET GLOBAL SQL_MODE='TRADITIONAL,ALLOW_INVALID_DATES,ONLY_FULL_GROUP_BY';
-- 3) adjusting your timeout settings to run longer queries
SET GLOBAL connect_timeout=28800;
SET GLOBAL wait_timeout=28800;
SET GLOBAL interactive_timeout=28800;
