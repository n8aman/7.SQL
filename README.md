### ER(entity relationship) diagram
Entities â€“ Real-world objects or concepts (e.g., Student, Course).

Attributes â€“ Properties of those entities (e.g., Student Name, Course Title).ðŸ”¸ Simple Attribute: Cannot be divided further.Example: FirstName ðŸ”¸ Composite Attribute: Can be broken into sub-parts.Example: FullName â†’ FirstName + LastName ðŸ”¸ Derived Attribute: Can be derived from other attributes.Example: Age from DOBðŸ”¸ Key Attribute: Uniquely identifies an entity.Example: StudentID

Relationships â€“ Associations between entities (e.g., A Student enrolls in a Course).ðŸ”¸ One-to-One (1:1): One entity relates to only one of another.ðŸ”¸ One-to-Many (1:N): One entity relates to many of another.ðŸ”¸ Many-to-Many (M:N): Many entities relate to many others.

-- INSTEAD OF TYPING THIS QUERY ALL THE TIME...
SELECT title, released_year, genre, rating, first_name, last_name FROM reviews
JOIN series ON series.id = reviews.series_id
JOIN reviewers ON reviewers.id = reviews.reviewer_id;
 -- WE CAN CREATE A VIEW:
CREATE VIEW full_reviews ASSELECT title, released_year, genre, rating, first_name, last_name FROM reviews
JOIN series ON series.id = reviews.series_id
OIN reviewers ON reviewers.id = reviews.reviewer_id;
 
-- NOW WE CAN TREAT THAT VIEW AS A VIRTUAL TABLE 
-- (AT LEAST WHEN IT COMES TO SELECTING)
SELECT * FROM full_reviews;

CREATE OR REPLACE VIEW ordered_series AS

### joins
-- To perform a (kind of useless) cross join:SELECT * FROM customers, orders;
-- The order doesn't matter here:SELECT * FROM ordersJOIN customers ON customers.id = orders.customer_id; or vice versa.
JOIN____ON_________
INNER JOIN, LEFT JOIN, RIGHT JOIN,
GROUP BY first_name , last_name
ORDER BY total{first_name, last_name, SUM(amount) AS total};


### GROUP BY
(HAVING, ROLLUP,) COUNT(rating) > 1; GROUP BY title WITH ROLLUP;

### interviewQ
What's a good use case for CHAR? -- Used for text that we know has a fixed length, e.g., State abbreviations, -- abbreviated company names, etc.
What is A unique key also enforces uniqueness like a primary key, but it can accept one null value
Indexes are special lookup tables that speed up data retrieval in a database.
What's the difference between DATETIME and TIMESTAMP?-- They both store datetime information, but there's a difference in the range, -- TIMESTAMP has a smaller range. TIMESTAMP also takes up less space.-- TIMESTAMP is used for things like meta-data about when something is created-- or updated.

--FOREIGN KEY (customer_id) REFERENCES customers (id) ON DELETE CASCADE
